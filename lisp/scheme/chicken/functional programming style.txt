Functional Programming Style

1. You only read variables that are passed into the function or are created by the function (So you don't read any global variables)
2. You never change the value of a variable that has already been set (So no incrementing variables or other such foolishness)
3. You never interact with the outside world, besides returning a result value. (So no writing to files, no writing messages for the user)
