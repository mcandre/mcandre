<p><b>Definition of pi:</b></p>
<p><img src="pi.gif" alt="circle with radius r and diameter d"
align="left" width="163" height="164" border="0">What is pi (the
symbol is the small Greek letter <img src="pi0.gif" alt="pi" width=
"16" height="15" border="0">)? It is equal to C/d, or C/2r, where C
is the circumference of any circle, and d is its diameter, and r is
its radius.</p>
<p>Euclid proved that this ratio (C/d) is always the same, no
matter the size of the circle. What he did was inscribe similar
regular polygons in any two circles. Then, he increased the number
of sides of the inscribed regular polygons. He reasoned that as the
number of sides increased, the perimeter of the inscribed polygon
gets closer and closer to the circumference of the circle. He also
showed that the perimeters of the similar polygons were
proportional to the radii of the circles in which they were
inscribed. And so, C is proportional to r, in other words C/r is a
constant. By convention, <b>pi=C/2r</b>. And we can use that as our
definition of pi.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Definition of pi: <b>pi=C/2r</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since we know pi to many decimal places, the following version
of the same equation becomes fairly useful:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Circumference formula: <b>C=2(pi)r</b></p>

<p><b>Value of pi:</b></p>
<p>Archimedes approximated pi, by inscribing and circumscribing a
circle with polygons of many sides. He showed that
3+10/71&lt;pi&lt;3+1/7 (in other words, 3.1408450704225 . . . &lt;
pi &lt; 3.142857142857142857 . . . ). Now, pi is approximated by
computers, using infinite series.</p>
<p>Pi is about:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>3.14159 26535 89793 23846 26433 83279 50288 41971 69399 37510
58209 74944 59230 78164 06286 20899 86280 34825 34211 70679 82148
08651 . . .</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of my mathematics teachers (in High School, as I recall)
told us that pi was exactly 22/7 (3+1/7), which is
3.142857142857142857 . . . Notice that it repeats every six digits.
It is not bad (three digits of accuracy), but certainly not exact.
By the way, the square root of 10 is fairly close to pi:
3.162277660168... (only two digits of accuracy). Using sqr() as the
square root function, sqr(3)+sqr(2)=3.146264369942 . . . (about
three digits of accuracy). Fiddling around with ratios, I found
that 20/9 times the square root of 2 is 3.142696805274... (three
digits of accuracy), which is slightly closer than 22/7. Much
closer is 355/113, which is 3.141592920354 . . . (seven digits of
accuracy). Kochansky's approximation is sqrt(40/3-2sqrt(3)), which
is 3.141533... (about four digits of accuracy).</p>

<p><b>Area of a circle:</b></p>
<p><img src="pi1.gif" alt="area of a circle" align="left" width=
"163" height="164" border="0">At the top of this article, I said
that Euclid proved that C/2r is a constant. C/2r eventually became
known as pi, and is our definition of pi. We need to figure out the
area of a circle.</p>
<p>Let's say that we approximate a circle with a regular polygon of
n sides. This diagram shows three of those sides, with length P/n
(where P is the perimeter of the polygon). And I have drawn a
triangle by drawing two of the radii. The area of this triangle is
approximately Pr/2n (the altitude is close to r), and as the number
of sides of our polygon increases, the area of the triangle gets
closer and closer to Cr/2n. In other words, the altitude of the
triangle gets closer and closer to r, and the perimeter of the
polygon gets closer and closer to the circumference of the circle.
There are n of these triangles filling up the circle. So the area
of the circle is about A=nCr/2n=Cr/2. Our definition of pi was
<b>C=2(pi)r</b>. Substituting this for C, we get
<b>A=(pi)r<sup>2</sup></b>. So we now know where these two famous
equations come from.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Area formula: <b>A=(pi)r<sup>2</sup></b></p>

<p><b>Addendum #1 (comments):</b></p>
<p>I hear that the dimensions of the Great Pyramid (of Khufu, also
known as Cheops) show that the ancient Egyptians knew the value of
pi. Those people who measure the dimensions of pyramids claim
tremendous accuracy, much more accuracy than the rough exterior of
a pyramid warrants. So, when they say that the Great Pyramid
exhibits the value pi, to many decimal places, a person should be
skeptical. But, it is also not very remarkable that the ancient
Egyptians might have used pi in this pyramid. It seems that the
base (much of it is missing) of the pyramid is within a few inches
of being square, and is just a few minutes of arc from being
aligned with true north, very accurate indeed.</p>
<p>By the way, there are many pyramids, and each has a different
slope. So, the Great Pyramid is the only one with just those
dimensions and ratios. There is also evidence that the ancient
Egyptians preferred a steeper slope than that of the Great Pyramid,
but had to settle for shallower slopes, to keep the pyramids from
collapsing.</p>
<p>The ancient Egyptians seem to have sometimes used a value of
22/7 for pi. There is also evidence that they estimated the area of
a circle with a square with a side that is 8/9 the size of the
circle's diameter. This gives a value of pi of 3.16049382716 . .
.</p>
<p>See <a href="../pseudo/pyramid.htm">Pi and the Great
Pyramid</a>.</p>
<p>Any fool can figure that the value of pi is a little greater
than 3, if he/she wants to experiment a little. Draw a circle, the
larger the better, and measure the diameter and the circumference
(with a string perhaps). Calculate pi=C/2r. You will probably get 3
or 4 digits of accuracy. If you are really good at that sort of
thing, you may be able to get 5 digits. That's pretty good. That's
better than Archimedes. Try that for a simple low-tech science fair
project.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Addendum #2 (trigonometric series):</b></p>
<p>Here are a couple of series which can be used to approximate
pi:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>pi/4=1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + 1/9 - . . .</p>
<p>pi<sup>2</sup>/12=1 - 1/4 + 1/9 - 1/16 + 1/25 - . . .</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first one converges to pi/4 very slowly. The second one is
quite a bit faster. There are much better series than these. The
first one evidently comes from this series (use x=1):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>arctan(x)=x - x<sup>3</sup>/3 + x<sup>5</sup>/5 -
x<sup>7</sup>/7 + x<sup>9</sup>/9 - . . .</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The arctangent of x is in radians. Here are some more
series:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>pi<sup>2</sup>/6=1 + 1/4 + 1/9 + 1/16 + 1/25 + . . .</p>
<p>pi<sup>2</sup>/8=1 + 1/9 + 1/25 + 1/49 + . . .</p>
<p>pi<sup>2</sup>/24=1/4 + 1/16 + 1/36 + 1/64 + . . .</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let's try each of these series for 1000 terms, on my computer.
Here are the results:</p>
<table width="500" border="1">
<tr>
<td><b>series</b></td>
<td><b>pi</b></td>

<tr>
<td>pi/4=1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + 1/9 - ...</td>

<p>The last series gave almost exactly the same answer as the third
one. The second one was by far the best (about seven digits of
accuracy). After 10000 terms, it produces a couple more digits of
accuracy: 3.14159264404146</p>

<p><b>Addendum #3 (comments):</b></p>
<p>If you have similar triangles (they have the same shape), their
areas are equal to some common ratio <b>s</b> times one of the
sides (or other part, like an angle bisector) squared. The same
thing is true of quadrilaterals and other polygons. In the case of
squares, which are all similar to each other, <b>s</b> is 1, the
area of a square is the side squared. In the case of a circle (all
circles are similar), when the part in question is the radius, then
<b>s</b> is pi.</p>
<p>An interesting attempt to estimate pi is this: Drop a needle
onto a paper with equally spaced lines on it. Keep track of how
many times the needle touches a line, and how many times it does
not touch a line. Pi=2L/Pd, where L is the length of the needle, d
is the distance between lines, and P is the probability of touching
a line. <b>P</b> is estimated by <b>hits/tries</b>, tries is the
number of times you dropped the needle, and hits are how many times
the needle touched a line. This method is inefficient. Thousands of
tries will result in only about 4 digits of accuracy. In 1901,
Lazzerini (I do not know his first name) used this method to
calculate pi to 6 decimal places, using only 3408 tosses of a
needle, a result that sounds to most mathematicians like
cheating.</p>

<p><b>Addendum #4 (calculus):</b></p>
<p><img src="pi3.gif" alt="tall thin rectangles" align="left"
width="153" height="79" border="0">In Calculus, we may estimate pi
by estimating the area of a semicircle. Here we will use a radius
of 1. We know the equation of this semicircle:
x<sup>2</sup>+y<sup>2</sup>=1, or y=sqrt(1-x<sup>2</sup>), where
sqrt() is the square root function. We estimate the area on a
computer, using thin rectangles, which have width <b>delta x</b> (a
small increment of <b>x</b>) and height <b>y</b>. We will choose
<b>x</b> to be half-way between the left and right sides of each
tall rectangle (this gives us a closer fit between the semicircle
and the many rectangles). We will get the area, which we already
know is (pi)r<sup>2</sup>/2 (because it is a semicircle). Since
r=1, our sum should be pi/2. So, to estimate pi, I will double our
sum. I'll just run the program, and report the results:</p>

<p>This last one has 8 digits of accuracy and took about three
minutes to run in a slow interpreter computer language.</p>

<p><b>My Sleazy Method</b> of estimating pi:</p>
<p><img src="pi2.gif" alt="Jim's method" align="left" width="163"
height="164" border="0">Here is my own sleazy method for estimating
pi. In the diagram, sin a=x, and pi is approximately (360 sin a)/2a
or <b>pi=(180 sin a)/a</b>, as a gets small. Angle a is measured in
degrees. Let's try this formula on a few values of a, using a
calculator:</p>
<table width="500" border="1">
<tr>
<td><b>a</b></td>

</table>
<p>That is very impressive, about 13 digits of accuracy for that
last one. Think about the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Question: Can you figure out what is strange about my
method?</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Answer: My calculator converts the angle to radians, and then
uses several terms of an infinite series to estimate the sine. Here
is my equation in radians: pi=(pi sin a)/a. We are using pi to
estimate pi. Pi=3.14159265358979 is hard coded into my calculator.
We are using pi with 15 digits of accuracy to estimate pi to 13
digits of accuracy. That is fairly foolish.</p>
<hr>
<p>Here is a sleazy fraction which seems to be close to pi:
10471975511/3333333333. This is 3.141592653614 . . ., a remarkable
11 digits of accuracy. OK, I confess. All I did was find the
fraction that is the repeating decimal 3.1415926536 1415926536 14 .
. ., and reduce it to its lowest terms.</p>
<p>Here is another: 10000000000/3183098862=3.141592653429... That
is 9 digits of accuracy. I cheated again. I used pi to figure out
the denominator.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Addendum #5 (a complicated series):</b></p>
<p>There are many series for estimating pi. One of the best
(fastest converging) is:</p>
<p><img src="pi4.gif" alt="complicated series" width="565" height=
"58" border="0"></p>
<p>which gives about 14 more digits of accuracy for every new term.
It was discovered by D. &amp; G. Chudnovsky in 1987. Series like
this are probably the ones used by the super computers. Srinivasa
Ramanujan was apparently a pioneer in creating several of these
complicated, and rapidly converging series.</p>
<p>Alternating series (the terms alternate between positive and
negative), like this one and the first two series above, are
handier to use, because they automatically give a simple estimate
of the error. The true value is always somewhere between the last
sum and the next to last sum.</p>
<p>In 1997, pi was calculated to a record 51,539,600,000 digits, by
Y. Kanada.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Addendum #6 (Indiana bill):</b></p>
<p>In 1897, the Indiana State House of Representatives passed a
bill (House Bill 246) supposedly setting the value of pi. The bill
was defeated in the Senate, despite support from the State
Superintendent of Education. It was written by Edward J. Goodwin
(who was offering his mathematical results to the State of Indiana,
"free of charge"), and introduced by Representative Taylor I.
Record. According to David Singmaster, in the <i>Mathematical
Intelligencer</i>, the bill was actually ambiguous, and seemed to
say that pi is equal to the following values:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>4<br>
3.3333 . . .<br>
3.2<br>
3.555558<br>
3.232488<br>
3.265306</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It also implied that the square root of 2 is 10/7. The bill can
be found in several sources, including the Indiana State Library.

<p><b>Addendum #7 (Archimedes):</b></p>
<p><img src="pi5.gif" alt="doubling the number of sides" align=
"left" width="164" height="158">How did Archimedes estimate pi? The
following is a rough approximation of his method. In the diagram on
the left, I have drawn one side (with length x) of a polygon
inscribed in a circle with radius of 1/2. Then I double the number
of sides, producing sides of length y. What is y in terms of x?
Application of <a href="pythag.htm">The Pythagorean Theorem</a>,
leads to y=sqrt(1/2-sqrt(1-x)/2). If we start with a hexagon, then
x=1/2, and pi is approximated by 6x. I will then use a computer to
calculate y, producing a dodecagon (12-gon). Pi is then
approximated by 12y. Then y becomes my next x, and I can double the
number of sides again, approximating pi with 24y. Archimedes was
satisfied with a 96-gon. In the following table, I went on to a
24576-gon:</p>

<p>I started losing accuracy after that. I assume that the
available square root function is not particularly accurate (about
10 digits). Archimedes not only inscribed a polygon, but he also
circumscribed a similar polygon. That would give an upper and lower
bound on the answer. So he would know about how accurate he was.
But, he didn't have algebra and a computer. So, he stopped at a
96-gon (and his work is difficult to follow without algebra). We
and Archimedes started with a hexagon. We could have started with a
square, which wouldn't have been any more difficult.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Addendum #8 (science fair project):</b></p>
<p><img src="pi6.gif" alt="estimating pi by hand" width="511"
height="511"></p>
<p>Here I have drawn a quarter circle on a 50x50 grid. With a side
of 50, the area of the quarter circle should be pi(2500)/4 or
625pi. I have colored the squares that are at least halfway within
the quarter circle. My estimate of pi should be the number of blue
squares divided by 625. That is 1965/625 or 3.144. That is 3 digits
of accuracy, almost as good as Archimedes. It was not very tedious
counting the 1965 blue squares, as I didn't have to count every
square: the bottom 7 rows are all 50, then next 5 rows are 49, etc.
A finer grid, and a larger circle should give us more accuracy.</p>
<p>This method may make a good <b>Science Fair Project</b>.
Carefully draw a quarter circle on a very large sheet of graph
paper. Probably tape your paper to a smooth floor. You probably
want to make the paper small enough so that it will fit in a
typical science fair display. But a really huge sheet of paper,
with photographs to document just how large it is, would also be
nice. Then add some text explaining how you did it (maybe with
photographs showing the steps). And display your estimate of pi.
Keep records of your arithmetic, and check it several times. If you
miss a row, you will be disappointed with the results.</p>
<p>Another way to use a grid like the above, is to connect the
diagonals of various rectangles, and estimate pi with a length
instead of an area. This should give you a little more accurate
results. But it takes a lot more arithmetic, as there are square
roots everywhere.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Area of a circle:</b></p>
<p><img src="pi7.gif" alt="area formula" align="left" width="213"
height="179">A popular way to prove the area formula is to arrange
slices of the circle as shown here. As the slices get thinner, the
figure gets closer and closer to a rectangle with sides of r and
c/2. We can substitute 2(pi)r for c (definition of pi). Then
<b>A=(pi)r<sup>2</sup></b>.</p>

<p><b>Addendum #10 (more trig):</b></p>
<p>Above, I said the formula pi/4=1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + 1/9 - ...
came from this series for the arctangent (inverse tangent) of
x:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>arctan(x)=x - x<sup>3</sup>/3 + x<sup>5</sup>/5 -
x<sup>7</sup>/7 + x<sup>9</sup>/9 - ...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, this arctan series is also used in other (harder to
derive) formulas for pi:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>pi=20 arctan(1/7) + 8 arctan(3/79)</p>
<p>pi=4 arctan(1/2) + 4 arctan(1/5) + 4 arctan(1/8)</p>
<p>pi=16 arctan(1/5) - 4 arctan(1/239)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just use the arctan series to evaluate arctan(1/2), and
arctan(1/5), etc. These happen to converge much more rapidly than
the pi/4=1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + 1/9 - ... series. Normally, these
are given as producing pi/4. I just multiplied by 4. There are
other formulas involving arctangents and pi.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Addendum #11 (the Borweins &amp; Ramanujan):</b></p>
<p>Jonathan and Peter Borwein (at one time holders of the world
record for most digits of pi) give the following computer
algorithms for calculating pi (which I modified slightly). In both
methods, <b>a</b> approaches 1/pi (* is multiplication, ^2 is
squared, sqr(2) is the square root of 2):</p>
<p>Method A:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>start: n=0; y=1/sqr(2); a=1/2;<br>
repeat: n=n+1; y=(1-sqr(1-y^2))/(1+sqr(1-y^2));
a=(a*(1+y)^2)-y*2^(n+1);</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Method B (really efficient):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>start: n=0; y=sqr(2)-1; a=6-4*sqr(2);<br>
repeat: {n=n+1; y=(1-sqr(sqr(1-y^4)))/(1+sqr(sqr(1-y^4)));<br>
a=(a*(1+y)^4)-y*(1+y+y^2)*2^(2*n+3)};</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, instead of y^2, use y*y, which is way faster. Also,
after a few iterations, you will need to do your own multiple
precision arithmetic. Method A gives 19 digits of accuracy after
four iterations. Method B gives 694 digits of accuracy after only
four iterations. The Borweins say that it may be the most efficient
known algorithm for calculating pi. It has been used to set several
world records.</p>
<p><img src="pi8.gif" alt="a formula by Ramanujan" align="left"
width="277" height="44" border="0">Here is a formula by Srinivasa
Ramanujan (1914). It converges rapidly, giving about 8 more digits
of pi, every iteration.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Addendum #12 (more series):</b></p>
<p>Newton apparently used the following series (and the fact that
the arcsin(1/2)=pi/6) to estimate pi:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
arcsin(x)=x+(1)(x^3)/(2)(3)+(1)(3)(x^5)/(2)(4)(5)+(1)(3)(5)(x^7)/(2)(4)(6)(7)+
. . .</p>
<p>
pi/6=1/2+1/(2)(3)(2^3)+3/(2)(4)(5)(2^5)+(3)(5)/(2)(4)(6)(7)(2^7)+ .
. .</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With better notation, you don't need all those parentheses.
Another series based on the arctangent series is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(pi^2)/18=1-1/(3)(3)+1/(3^2)(5)-1/(3^3)(7)+1/(3^4)(9)- . . .</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And here is an infinite product:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>pi/2=2/1x2/3x4/3x4/5x6/5x6/7x . . .</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is my own series:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>pi /8=1/(1x3)+1/(5x7)+1/(9x11)+1/(13x15)+ . . .</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Near the beginning of this article, I said that sqr(3)+sqr(2) is
approximately pi. Well sqr(3)-sqr(2) is approximately 1/pi. Is that
a coincidence? No, it turns out that
sqr(3)-sqr(2)=1/(sqr(3)+sqr(2)). A little algebra turns the
expression on the right into the one on the left.</p>

<p><b>Addendum #13 (pi=3.14868804...?):</b></p>
<p>I have received email from Peter J. Spencer who says that he can
prove that pi=3.14868804... He has a formula, and has calculated it
to 293 decimal places. He says that this has all been verified by a
retired mathematics professor and a computer. Above (addendum #4),
I use integral calculus to approximate pi, using thinner and
thinner rectangles to approximate the area of a semicircle. Let's
do that again:</p>

</pre>
<p>This time, while estimating pi, I have deduced lower and upper
bounds on pi (much as Archimedes did). All of this could be done by
hand, except that it would be very tedious to sum 100,000,000 small
rectangles. So the process is not at all mysterious. I used an
actual circle of radius 1. The area of each rectangle can be found
to any accuracy needed. In each of the narrowest rectangles, the
width is 0.00000001 and the height is calculated using the
pythagorean theorem. Again, this can be calculated to any accuracy
needed (as it is an exact formula). The lower bound is found by
making the rectangles all fit within the unit semicircle. The upper
bound is found by making the upper side just fit outside the unit
semicircle (so the circle is inside the collection of
rectangles).</p>
<p>Here, I got fifteen digits of accuracy (which is the most
accuracy that I can get out of this particular square root
function). We can assume that the last digit may be somewhat
inaccurate. I could print out a few square roots to verify this;
but I won't. In the last row, we find that pi is between
3.14159263358948 and 3.14159267358948. The value of pi given by Mr.
Spencer, 3.14868804..., is not in that range. That should convince
anyone that his contention is false. No matter where he got his
formula, it has nothing to do with circumferences or areas of
circles.</p>
<p>These formulas are the work of Mr. Spencer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>pi=3z=C/d<br>
C=xy<sup>7</sup>z<sup>2</sup><br>
d=xy<sup>7</sup>z/3<br>
C=10!<br>
x=4<br>
y=7<br>
z=360/7<sup>3</sup><br>
pi=3628800/1152480=3.14868804...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He still contends that his "pi" is correct, and furthermore is
rational (3628800/1152480 which reduces to 1080/343). A rational
number is an integer divided by an integer (see <a href=
"../algebra/irration.htm">Irrational Numbers</a>).</p>
<p>All this is a mystery to me. His pi is not pi. Euclid proved
that C/d is the same for all circles. There are many ways to
measure pi, using real circles (equations of circles), to any
desired accuracy. Above, I have proved, using a real circle, that
pi is within a fairly narrow range, and 3.14868804 . . . is not in
that range.</p>
<hr>
<p>Of course, Mr. Spencer is still not convinced. Here is a little
history about pi:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Archimedes conjectured (guessed) that pi is irrational. In 1761
(said to be 1766 in some books), Johann Heinrich Lambert proved
that pi is irrational. And his proof is apparently very difficult.
I have not seen the proof. Legendre proved it in 1794. In 1947,
Ivan Niven proved it fairly easily. That proof is described in
<i>Proofs from THE Book</i> (by M. Aigner and G. Ziegler) as "an
elegant one-page proof that needs only elementary calculus." It
also requires a couple more pages of proofs of preliminary
theorems. Further results from that proof are that pi squared is
irrational, and that e^r is irrational for every rational r not
equal to zero. It has further been shown, by Lindemann in 1882,
that pi is transcendental number (in other words, it is not the
root of any polynomial equation with integer coefficients). The
proof of that is apparently very difficult indeed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Above, Mr. Spencer gives z as pi/3. In email, he asks why people
think that z is transcendental. Of course, no one has heard of z.
They claim that pi is transcendental, which would mean that Mr.
Spencer's z is also transcendental, <b>if the equation z=pi/3 were
true</b>. Let's forget about "transcendental," as that is a
difficult concept, and deal with "irrational." Pi is irrational.
Therefore, z must be irrational, if z=pi/3 is true. Above, we see
these equations:</p>
<blockquote>C=xy<sup>7</sup>z<sup>2</sup><br>
d=xy<sup>7</sup>z/3<br></blockquote>
<p>Mr. Spencer chooses C=10! (ten factorial). And he defines x=4
and y=7. Then he solves the first equation for z and finds that
3z=3.14868804 . . . and is rational. The second equation is not
necessary, except to balance the 3z=C/d equation. Well, 3z is not
pi, as I proved above. I actually proved that pi is between
3.14159263358948 and 3.14159267358948. 3z (3.14868804 . . .) is not
equal to pi.</p>
<hr>
<p>Mr. Spencer is still trying to convince me. I sent him this
rather sarcastic (but accurate, in my opinion) summary of what he
has done:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We want "pi" to be 1080/343 (or 3x360/7<sup>3</sup> or
3.14868804 . . .) and not 3.1415926535 . . . Then we choose an
integer (10! or 3628800) with lots of factors as the circumference
C of our circle. For no good reason, we will define a z="pi"/3 and
we find that 10!=(4)(7<sup>7</sup>)(z<sup>2</sup>). We used
7<sup>7</sup> to cancel out the 7's in the denominator of
z<sup>2</sup>, since 7 is only a factor of 10! once. And who knows
why we chose z<sup>2</sup> instead of z? There is no pi<sup>2</sup>
in C=(pi)d. Solving for z, we find that it is (surprise!) 360/343.
And therefore (surprise!) "pi"=3.14868804 . . .</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I told him that the above <b>IS</b> my understanding of his
methods. He didn't seem to like the tone of the above. Anyway, this
is all algebraic fiddling and has nothing whatsoever to do with a
circle. We threw in 360 just to pretend that we might be dealing
with a circle.</p>

<p><b>Addendum #14:</b></p>
<p><img src="pi10.gif" alt="area" align="left" width="657" height=
"175" border="0">On the far left we see a number of concentric
circles, the largest of which has a radius of <b>r</b>. To the
right of that, we see each of the circles unrolled into straight
lines filling a right triangle. We know that the right end of each
line is in a straight line because its length is proportional to
its original radius. It would seem that the triangle has the same
area as the circle. This may be obvious or it may not be obvious.
We can probably prove it using limits. Anyway, we see that the area
of the triangle is <b>(pi)r<sup>2</sup></b>. This is a fairly
popular proof of the area formula.</p>
