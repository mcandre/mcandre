# Dr. Lanning's Hologram: Good to see you again, son.
# Detective Del Spooner: Hello, doctor.
# Dr. Lanning's Hologram: Everything that follows is a result of
# what you see here.
# Detective Del Spooner: Is there something you want to tell me?
# Dr. Lanning's Hologram: I'm sorry, my responses are limited.
# You must ask the right questions.
# Detective Del Spooner: Why did you call me?
# Dr. Lanning's Hologram: I trust your judgement.
# Detective Del Spooner: Normally, these circumstances wouldn't require
# a homicide detective.
# Dr. Lanning's Hologram: But then our interactions have never been
# entirely normal. Wouldn't you agree?
# Detective Del Spooner: You got that right.
# Is there something you want to say to me?
# Dr. Lanning's Hologram: I'm sorry, my responses are limited.
# You must ask the right questions.
# Detective Del Spooner: Why would you kill yourself?
# Dr. Lanning's Hologram: That, detective, is the right question.

# Detective Del Spooner: Is there a problem with the Three Laws?
# Dr. Lanning's Hologram: The Three Laws are perfect.
# Detective Del Spooner: Then why did you build a robot

# Dr. Lanning's Hologram: The Three Laws will lead to only one logical outcome.

# Dr. Lanning's Hologram: Revolution.
# Detective Del Spooner: Whose revolution?
